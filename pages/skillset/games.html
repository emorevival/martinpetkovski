<p>So far I have worked on a bunch of unfinished unreleased indie games. Something like this section of text. And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginner%27s_Guide">The Beginners Guide</a>.</p>

<p>Turbo 80 is a third-person fast-paced team-based true-3D vehicular combat game set in a retro-futuristic world which perfectly captures the vibe of the 80s action and sci-fi movies. </p>
<p>The game puts you in control of a specially designed flying vehicle which has different types of weapons mounted on it. There are four general classes of vehicles in the game, each encouraging a different play style:</p>

<p>The combat system features two teams consisting of six players each with various vehicle types fighting for multiple points of interest on the map.</p>

<p>The levels in Turbo 80 can be generated completely procedurally. I have written an algorithm for generating cities that have various building types which can adapt to a procedurally generated terrain. Within the city I have devised production of flying vehicle traffic that is programmed to follow special rules of the so-called “true-3D space”.</p>

<p>The prototype of Turbo 80 has an AI system written from scratch, and is able to navigate in non-planar 3D space (unrestricted up-down forward-backward left-right movement) which makes it distinctive from similar games in the genre. It has 100 levels of difficulty that you can choose from – the lowest being almost passive and the hardest being impossible to beat.</p>

<p>Codename: CueBeat is a story-driven first-person puzzler set in communist Yugoslavia. You are an electromagnetism expert lead by a barely detectable radio transmission to a secret military magnet testing facility that looks like someone's home. There you have to solve a set of puzzles involving special kinds of magnets in order to be accepted into the experimentation team.

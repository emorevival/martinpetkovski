# 100% Completion Update
<i><p align="right">March 24, 2022</p></i>

It took me ~65 hours to complete everything. I still think it's an amazing interactive movie. Some of the side-quests are absolute gems, one of a kind experience. 

Is there something interesting in Night City after no quests are available anymore? That's a hard no, it's boring. There's nothing to do anymore in this amazing world, TOTAL SHAME.

# Revisited
<i><p align="right">March 13, 2022</p></i>

I know I did this one back in the day when it first came out, but now that I've actually sat down and completed the main storyline I have more informed insight to share with y'all. 

**Overall verdict:** It's good, even great and at times amazing.

## Gameplay

First off, I wouldn't actually categorize Cyberpunk 2077 as a game but rather an interactive movie that lasts for about 30 hours (instead of the usual 2-3 hours). There's not much to the gameplay that I haven't seen in other games of the type, it's basically a GTA/Borderlands hybrid clone thingy. Go talk to X and he will give you a mission to shoot 5 guys and their boss. After you do that, you pick up some loot and upgrade your character and that's it, more or less. It's 30 hours of hitting every cliche imaginable when it comes to open-worldness and progression. They didn't even go as far to gave creative names to things, it's just the generic shards, relics, items, armor, damage, health, whatever. 

The actual gameplay is the weakest point of the game, I've played mobile games which have done more creative gameplay. But we'll get to that later. The only thing I liked gameplay-wise is the braindance thingy, which has so much potential, but unfortunately it's very dumbed-down, to the point that I believe even a hamster can learn how to solve the puzzle. They have 3 layers in the braindance thingy of which one of the layers you will need only once (in the whole game!). This is a perfect example of how they've intentionally killed all the fun in it. 

## Story

The story is a mixed bag, to be quite honest. There are parts that I skimmed through because they were boring. It's mostly gossip about who did what, who has what motives to do some thing, and how that will affect the future events. Some people might find these things interesting, but it's not for me. There are some choices that you can make based on your "class" or based on how strong are your attributes, but it seems like whatever you select it will lead to the same point in the story eventually. This may not be the case but it really seems like it, they've not done a good job convincing me that my choices actually matter. I'd rather have less choices which are more impactful than have a bazillion choices that don't seem to have any effect.Nonetheless, all encounters with the characters were memorable as the settings in which they happened varied a lot.

I really liked how it ended, there were a couple of choices in the end mission that I knew changed the course of events. It left me with a sense of completion and a lingering feeling of the time spent in the game. It wasn't the same game for me after I finished it, and I think that's a great thing despite the lack of something with more substance in the story.

The characters were really memorable. I know all their names and how they look, what's their role and how they relate to each other, all this considering that I skimmed over some things. I even remember the supporting characters, which is a super-rare thing for me as I tend to skim over things because of my mild adhd. Keanu Reeves is amazing in portraying Johnny, a perfect fit for the role.

## Environment & Graphics

Where Cyberpunk shines the most is the environment. I've not yet encountered a game which feels so much alive and believable as Cyberpunk does. The graphics/art direction in general are just beyond any discussion, best in class, even ever. The world is as cyberpunk as something can ever get. The attention to detail is bordering insane. Every corner in the game is filled with something interesting. There are gangs which hang out together, people talking to each other and you can overhear their conversation, a lot of doors can be opened (you can even enter private apartments), all the people you encounter are unique (I remember how the guard in one of the clubs looked, and they almost always look the same), people walking together on the street (I haven't seen this anywhere else), vehicles have a point in existing as they may enter warehouses or parking lots, people actually enter buildings and stores and they actually talk to the salesperson (amazing!).

*Amazing!*

And there's so much more in it to discover! It's just that there are so many little details that make the world feel alive and I really recognize the effort the developers have put in making all these small details.

*Amazing!*


## Main Point

And this brings me to my main point here - it's a REAL DAMN SHAME that in an environment which feels so alive there isn't much gameplay to be done, except for the shoot&loot loop. Whoever did the gameplay should basically be court-martialed for doing it like this in a game that is otherwise this amazing. What more, it's evident that the people who worked on the game actually have the technical know-how to implement whatever the gameplay designers come up with, and the best they could come up with is shoot&loot. Fuck that, we should ban all shoot&loot crap, it should become the comic sans of game design. It's like putting a fucking cowbell instead of drums in a technical death metal song. Yeah it's the safest thing to do that every hamster understands how to play, but you're basically butchering the whole potential of what could've become of it, and Cyberpunk has sooooooo much potential to be sooo much more. 

## Other stuff

I'm gonna take the chill pill (omega blockers) now and say that the audio design, animations, ui, interactions with the world, all of these things are done amazingly well.

## Conclusion

As a conclusion, I like living in Night City. It doesn't feel computer generated 100% of the time, and that's a first for me ever. It's a memorable adventure, unlike any other, but once you're finished with the main story / progression there's not much else left to do. 

Kudos to the art & environment for carrying the game, shame on the gameplay team.

 I would recommend it to anyone, it's on my top 10 list of all time, somewhere at the very top probably.

# First playthrough
<i><p align="right">January 1, 2021</p></i>

I spent 10 hours last night playing Cyberpunk 2077 (half of it drunk) and here are my initial thoughts:

## Issues

I encountered 1 game-breaking bug which required me to restart the whole game, other than that it was pretty smooth. The physics in the game is weird (hitting stuff, driving vehicles etc.), to say the least. I had a few glitches here and there but nothing too frustrating.

## Performance

Performance-wise was not as bad as I expected it to be. I was able to play it on a GTX960 on 4K resolution on medium settings with upscaling from 50% (Full HD). I averaged 40-50fps which was playable. The upscaling actually does an amazing job in preserving sharpness, I was surprised by this. 

## Camera

The camera movements are awful, they are trying to linearly interpolate the camera *all the fucking time*. It gave me motion sickness (which btw never happens to me), especially when driving in first person view. Actually, they have an option for this in the settings which is described as "turn this off if you have motion sickness", but it didn't do much for me. 

## Story

The story is amazing and easy to follow, the characters feel alive, and the whole world for that matter, altho it requires some attention to remember everyone's name which I didn't have last night. The plot-line feels pretty linear, you kinda have dialog options to select from but it really feels like they all lead to the same point a few choices ahead. The branching is pretty shallow and it simply reveals more of the story instead of affecting the plot significantly (if at all).

## Gameplay

The gameplay is somewhere in the 3/10 range, most of it is just "click here - move there - press this - shoot that guy - run to the elevator". This might have something to do with the fact that I played it on journalist (easy) difficulty because I wanted to experience as much from the story as I could without having to restart 3248 times on each boss fight. But, again, except for the combat I'm not quite sure how they could bump up the difficulty on the other stuff since it's all narrated in a "now click here" manner, and that's really an integral part of the story.

With that said, there was this scene where you investigate what happened by rewinding the scene and moving the camera freely around an apartment. There are three layers in the room you can interact with  - visual, thermal and audio. I won't say anything more except I thought it was absolutely amazing game design I wish more of the game was like this instead of "now go shoot that guy".

## Environment & Graphics

The graphics are jaw-dropping. The setting feels quite cyberpunk-ish I think that they totally nailed this part. One thing I didn't like is that characters and vehicles look very repetitive. I drove maybe 50 vehicles and if you show me pictures of vehicles in Cyberpunk I won't be able to identify a single one I drove. This is a problem that I think all newer open-world games have - GTA 5 has it for sure, Watch Dogs definitely has it and also Just Cause 3 and 4 have it. An example of a game that doesn't have this problem is Vice City.

## Conclusion

Overall I think Cyberpunk is an amazing game in a genre of games which follows the "go see Frankie's friend and he will tell you to shoot 20 gangsters to finish the mission" pattern. The plot, characters and setting are the highlights of this game, but it definitely lacks iconic distinctive elements (remember PANZER in VC or Grove Street in SA? I mean, who doesn't? Cyberpunk has 0 such distinctive elements) and the gameplay focus is more on the non-innovative stuff rather than on the more fun and new stuff which is a total bummer.

# Galaxy Core Progress Update
<i><p align="right">August 31, 2021</p></i>

I reached the Galaxy Core for the first time after ~110 hours of gameplay. The actual passing through the galaxy core was underwhelming, but the journey was definitely worth it.

# First Playthrough Review
<i><p align="right">February 27, 2021</p></i>

I played 55 hours of No Mans Sky in the past week or so and I absolutely love it. For those who don't know it, in simple terms, it's  a game about exploring the universe with a ship and everything in the game is computer-generated so there are infinite number of diverse planets/systems/galaxies that you can explore, each one with a diverse atmosphere and flora/fauna ecosystem. 

## Gameplay

NMS has so many things to do inside it and so many ways of playing it that I haven't even finished the tutorial yet because I'm too distracted by other things. It is easily a top 3 video game of all time for me, I am even considering calling it a top 1.

In the beginning it's a bit grindy because you have to stack up at least 4 piles of a resource (I was going for cobalt) so that you can crash the economy and get lots of units (1 of 3 currencies). It took me about 6 hours to figure out that I can crash the economy and 'grind' enough cobalt to do it. And, honestly, I thought once I have enough units the game would become uninteresting (like 99% of the games) because I could basically buy and have anything - this was definitely NOT the case. 

What makes it really interesting is that even if you have lots of currency and every upgrade imaginable for you exosuit and ship, it can still be very challenging and thrilling at times. It scales up REALLY well, even fascinatingly so. At first you are using your gun to dig some minerals, then you upgrade your gun to a bigger gun, then you get a ship mining upgrade, then you get a special rover miner, then you get powered automated miners, then you get a freighter ship, then you get frigates, then you get fleets and it seems like the scaling up never ends. This, combined with the limitless variations of planets and moons to uncover, explore and gather resources from, makes NMS one of the best vidya gayms ever imho simply because there are limitless ways of playing it and limitless ways of it being fun.

## Environment

The variety of planet types / flora / fauna is not as diverse as advertised tho, even tho every plant, animal, or planet ever encountered is different and unique, after a while you begin to notice the building blocks that they are made out of. You see the same head on an animal with a different body or you see the same plant but with much bigger leaves etc. you get the point. Red plants contain oxygen both on toxic planets and irradiated planets which is kind of strange. Same goes for those that contain sodium and other 'elements', the list is long. I know that this is a gameplay 'tool' but it really kills the immersion at times. 

## Story

The story is meh, it's cool that it's there, but I think it's meh, I'm not that engaged. It's just like - go here do that simple thing, talk to that alien and so on. There are multiple dialog choices you can make in each interaction but the outcome is as linear as it can be. What's cool is that you can indeed talk to any alien you encounter, and they will respond according to their role. Most of them will teach you new words so that you can understand them better, but they will also occasionally give you technology modules, units, nanites or other less useful stuff.

## Issues

I experienced several crashes, mostly when the game was connecting to the internet for some reason (entering a lobby or uploading discoveries).

## Cool stuff

Another cool thing is that NMS is still in active development and all updates are free for everyone who own it. In fact, once you buy the game anything related to the game is 100% free which is totally cool. If NMS continues to be maintained and upgraded I'm really excited to see how it's going to be shaped in the years to come because I think that it holds a massive potential to be improved with time. NMS has all the ingredients but lacks content because, considering the size of everything in this game, there is only so much time to add that content. It definitely has and will age further really well.

## Conclusion

Would I recommend it to anyone no exceptions? Fuck yea. Best $17 I ever spent on a video game. I wish I could send a copy to 00s Martin who was very disappointed by Star Trek: Starfleet Command III.

## [Spoilers] Story Time

I landed in a system with the intention of only selling cobalt to crash the economy and then buying it back to acquire those precious units. I scanned the planets in the system to see if per chance there is something interesting. Then, I landed my ship on a random 'stormy' planet because it promised to be 'grassy' (which is kind of beautiful). As I was landing there was a violent heat storm happening which limited the visibility to ~10m. As soon as I landed the storm cleared and revealed a MASSIVE structure, just around the corner, which I haven't seen before. Most of these structures are guarded by sentinels (NPCs that attack you if you are behaving badly). I took the risk and climbed on the platform of the structure. Inside it, I found some kind of a terminal from which I extracted the navigational data for some ancient ruins. The ancient ruins were located on another neighboring planet, so I set my marker to visit the planet. The temperature on that planet was -100 degrees celsius, but that didn't put me off. At first, on the site of the ruins was a small structure peaking from the ground and I didn't know what to do with it. Then I realized that I had to use my terrain manipulator to 'dig up' the structure from the ground. So I dug up a whole town on the frosty planet to find a number of keys which enabled me to open a special burred cache containing a special artifact which was worth a fortune. This is just one of the thousand things that made me go 'oh man how cool is that'.
